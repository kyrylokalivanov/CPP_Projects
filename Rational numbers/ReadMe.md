About

This project implements a rational number class (wymierna) in C++. The class represents a rational number as a fraction (numerator and denominator) in the obliczenia namespace, ensuring the denominator is always positive and the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator is 1. It includes constructors, arithmetic operators (binary: +, -, *, /, +=, -=, *=, /=; unary: -, !), conversion operators to double and int, and a stream output operator for displaying rational numbers as decimals with repeating parts (e.g., 2359348/99900 as 23.61(709)). The implementation features a custom exception hierarchy derived from std::logic_error for handling overflow (przekroczenie_zakresu) and division by zero (dzielenie_przez_0). The program is split into header and source files, with comprehensive tests in main.cpp to verify all functionality, including copy semantics and exception handling.
